Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm built around the concept of *objects* — self-contained units that combine **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods) into a single entity.

== Why OOP Exists
Before OOP, most software followed a *procedural* style: step-by-step instructions operating on shared data. This worked for small programs but became messy and hard to maintain as systems grew. OOP solves this by modeling software after real-world entities, making code more modular, reusable, and easier to reason about.

== Core Principles of OOP

=== 1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation means bundling data and the methods that operate on it into a single unit, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

[source,java]
----
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
----
**Explanation:**  
Here, `balance` is private and cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. The only way to change or read it is through the `deposit` and `getBalance` methods, which control how the data is used.

=== 2. Abstraction
Abstraction hides implementation details and exposes only the necessary features.

Example: You can drive a car without knowing how the engine works — in code, this means exposing a simple interface while hiding complex internals.

=== 3. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another, promoting code reuse.

[source,java]
----
class Vehicle {
    void start() { System.out.println("Starting..."); }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void honk() { System.out.println("Beep!"); }
}
----
**Explanation:**  
`Car` inherits the `start()` method from `Vehicle` and adds its own `honk()` method. This lets you reuse existing behavior and extend it with new features.

=== 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism lets the same operation behave differently on different classes.

[source,java]
----
interface Shape { void draw(); }

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Circle"); }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Square"); }
}
----
**Explanation:**  
Both `Circle` and `Square` implement the same `Shape` interface, but each provides its own `draw()` method. This allows you to write code that works with `Shape` objects without knowing their exact type.

== Benefits of OOP
- **Modularity**: Code is organized into independent classes.
- **Reusability**: Classes can be reused across projects.
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one part of the system have minimal ripple effects.
- **Scalability**: Easier to extend with new features.

== Final Thoughts
OOP is not tied to a single language — it’s a way of thinking about and structuring code. Mastering its principles will make you a more effective developer, regardless of the tools you use.
