Java is often described as a *pure* object-oriented language — and while there’s debate about that term, there’s no doubt that Java’s design is deeply rooted in OOP principles.

== Everything Revolves Around Objects
In Java, almost everything (except primitives) is an object. Classes define the blueprint, and objects are the runtime instances that hold state and behavior.

[source,java]
----
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(String name, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public void raiseSalary(double percent) {
        salary += salary * percent / 100;
    }
}
----
**Explanation:**  
Here, `Employee` is a class (the blueprint), and each `Employee` object has its own `name` and `salary`. The `raiseSalary` method changes the state of that specific object — a core OOP idea.

== How Java Implements OOP Principles

=== 1. Encapsulation
Java enforces encapsulation through access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) and getter/setter methods.

=== 2. Inheritance
Java supports single inheritance via the `extends` keyword, and multiple inheritance of type via `interfaces`.

[source,java]
----
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Eating..."); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Barking..."); }
}
----
**Explanation:**  
`Dog` inherits the `eat()` method from `Animal` without rewriting it, and adds its own `bark()` method. This shows how Java reuses and extends behavior.

=== 3. Polymorphism
Java supports both compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding) polymorphism.

=== 4. Abstraction
Java provides `abstract` classes and `interfaces` to hide implementation details and define contracts.

[source,java]
----
interface PaymentProcessor {
    void process(double amount);
}

class CreditCardProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    public void process(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment: " + amount);
    }
}
----
**Explanation:**  
The `PaymentProcessor` interface defines *what* should be done (`process`), but not *how*. `CreditCardProcessor` provides the actual implementation. This allows different payment processors to be swapped without changing the calling code.

== Additional OOP-Friendly Features
- **Packages** for organizing classes into namespaces.
- **Garbage Collection** to manage object lifecycles automatically.
- **Strong Typing** to catch errors at compile time.

== Why This Matters
By embracing OOP, Java enables developers to:
- Model real-world systems naturally.
- Build modular, maintainable, and reusable codebases.
- Scale applications without losing structure.

== Conclusion
Java’s syntax, libraries, and runtime are all designed to encourage OOP best practices. Whether you’re building a small utility or a large enterprise system, understanding Java’s OOP features is key to writing clean, maintainable code.
